# Java with AppDynamics: Getting Started (Maven)

This is a fork of a barebones Java app, which can easily be deployed to Heroku. 
It should immediately pop up on the controller, 

# Drop your AppDynamics Agent zip in place of heroku-java-appdynamics-getting-started/src/appd/AppAgent.zip and you should be ready to deploy on Heroku. 

Changes include 
Procfile, pom.xml and a placeholder file for the agent zip 
Everything else is identical to the origianal heroku
